# Snippet Generator

This project is a code overhaul of [Pawel Grzybekâ€™s Snippet Generator](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/snippet-generator).

The Snippet Generator is a React App to help you create code snippet in VS Code, Atom, and Sublime text. I rewrote the code form the ground up to use React Hooks instead of class components. I also made the app scale much more easily while making it modular. It is not possible to create a generator for a new editor by simply creating a component and a single reference.

I am hosting the code on Netlify and a link can be found [here]().
